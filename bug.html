This bug is related to Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive. When using `@apply` with a utility class that contains pseudo-selectors like `&:hover`, the styles might not apply correctly, especially when nested within other components or conditional rendering. For instance, the hover styles might not take effect, or the `@apply` directive might cause unexpected behavior or conflicts with other styles.
