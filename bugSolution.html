The solution avoids using `@apply` with pseudo-selectors directly. Instead, it utilizes a more robust approach.  We create a separate class that defines the hover styles and apply it directly to the element. This removes the reliance on `@apply` to handle pseudo-selectors. 

Here is the updated code:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 hover:bg-blue-700">
  Hover me!
</div>
```

This ensures that the hover styles are applied correctly without conflicting with `@apply` directive.
